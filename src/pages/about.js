            How Fair's the Air?
              <p>
              The ubiquity of cheap sensors and networked devices means there's more and more live, publicly available air quality data. But is that enough to pull together into something that can provide real-time air quality alerts?
              </p>
              <p>
              This project will focus on researching publicly available data sources, and is really about putting together a service that adds value on top of them using the cloud as a platform. As an open-ended project, the focus is up to the team; from engineering to analytics - as long as it clears up something about the air!
