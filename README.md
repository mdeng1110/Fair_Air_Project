## Problem and Solutions
During this project, our team considered the fact that more people are concerned about air quality, especially during the fire season.  People can use different air quality data resources in order to prepare for fires and poor air quality.  We noticed that there is a problem.  The air quality data websites do not provide air quality alerts for people.  For our solution, we are creating air quality notifications that will help lots of people including those who suffer from underlying health conditions.  Anyone can utilize this product so that they can receive up to date air quality notifications.  To create the air quality alerts, we combine the data from multiple air quality sources. To display all these features, we built a platform on top of Amazon Web Services(AWS).
